Overview


A new era in the automotive industry has arrived. The increased complexity in vehicles required a software driven wireless solution; there just isnt the space for all the wires that would be required for todays connectivity. The automotive industry is now embracing the software defined vehicle which encompasses all the challenges seen in connected vehicles (CV) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAV). The internals within a vehicle have matured from being mechanically driven to microcontroller driven with the ability to connect internally (in vehicle), peer to peer to other vehicles (V2V)  and to 5G networks and road traffic masts (V2X). 

Software now controls the majority of functionality within vehicles, spanning safety, security, navigation and driver experience. [ref] separates applications into the following groups;

Safety services, covering automated emergency braking, detection of dangerous road conditions including black ice and potholes, and collision avoidance.

Mobility services including self parking and planning.

Information services including map generation, air quality monitoring and fuel efficiency optimisation. 

Computational services including in-car entertainment. 


The increased reliance of todays complex vehicles on software and the increased connectivity between the vehicle internals to external data collection and processing systems has led to increased attention from organisations such as the UNECE. They have published two security addenda to the 1958 Agreement; the addenda focus on cyber security within vehicles and come into force in 2024. Regulation R155 focusses on cyber security governance and OEM’s will require a certificate of compliance for their cyber security management system. The CSMS must cover the OEM’s development, production and post production phases. There must also be processes in place to continually monitor the security of vehicles including vulnerability assessments, risk assessments and threat analysis. Processes must be in place to detect and respond to security incidents. It is also the responsibility of the OEM to monitor its third party suppliers and manage their dependencies.

The second regulation, R156, covers providing safe and secure software updates through the implementation of a Software Update Management System. Traditional updates were carried out in approved garages but with todays connected vehicles, updates can be carried out over the air (OTA). Cloud Security Alliances automotive2cloud workgroup, focus on the security of the over the air (OTA) update process including its infrastructure and the implementation of a SUMS. We believe that this is a vital component in the lifecycle of vehicles and has an impact on the security of not just the vehicle but other road users. This is because the updates effect not just the infotainment systems but the firmware of ECU’s and powertrains controlling the motion and safety of the vehicle. Updates are not just at risk from cyber attacks but also misconfigurations, version control issues and updates which are not atomic especially as connectivity throughout the update process is not always guaranteed.


The Need For Over The Air Updates

The costs for an OEM to recall vehicles to an approved garage to receive an update can run into billions of euros. The figure reached 38 billion dollars in 2020 in the US alone. Annually, it is estimated that a quarter of cars on the road will be recalled for updates .The old common approach to updates relied on an engineer in a garage with a physical wired connection via authorised and authenticated diagnostic equipment to the car. This is an inefficient way of applying updates and many vulnerabilities can occur or be found in the software between updates. Its costly to the car manufacturer and inconvenient to the car owner. OTA offers a more cost effective, quicker way to apply updates but still requires authentication and authorisation processes but across cloud to cellular networks.  Inside the OEM supply chain, the software management process for updates is daunting with challenges ranging from the architecture inside vehicles, internal and external communication protocols, to the need for a secure, resilient, decentralised communication network.
