The cyber assets of cars are the valuable components, data, software, and functions within a vehicle or its related infrastructure that require protection against unauthorized access, modification, destruction, or denial of service. Identifying these assets is crucial for performing threat analysis and risk assessment (TARA).

<b>Cyber assets typically relate to four major security impact perspectives: Safety, Finance, Operations, and Privacy (SFOP).</b>

The main categories of cyber assets include:

<h1>I. Data, Information, and Credentials</h1>
Data is a prime asset, encompassing information generated by the vehicle, stored about the user, or constituting proprietary knowledge.

<h2>1. Personal and User Data (Privacy)</h2>
These assets include Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and records concerning the vehicle occupants and owner, requiring protection to meet privacy objectives.

<b>Owner’s privacy information.

Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

Location information </b>(location history, speed, and direction).

<b>Financial data and credentials, </b>including payment credentials for tolls, parking, and electric charging.

<b>Address book information.

Entertainment preferences.

Driver’s privacy policies.

Usage of vehicular application</b> (must not endanger the privacy policies of the respective driver/owner).

<h2>2. Intellectual Property (IP) and Confidential Data (Confidentiality)</h2>
These assets protect the interests of manufacturers, suppliers, and content providers.

<p></p>
<b></b>Proprietary data or trade secrets.

Intellectual property (IP).

Vehicular program code or data.

Engine characteristics.

Paid content </b>(e.g., copyright-protected media, navigational data, or news).

<h2>3. Critical Vehicle Status Data and Records (Integrity)</h2>
These assets relate to the operational history and current configuration of the vehicle.

Car data (technical data about the car).

Stored information about driving behavior.

Vehicle’s electronic ID.

Recorded driving data (which may be sent to a back-end system).

Data collected by event data recorders (EDR) or tachographs.

System event logs (must be protected from unauthorized deletion or manipulation).

Configuration parameters of key functions.

<h2>4. Security Credentials and Keys</h2>
These foundational assets protect authentication, integrity, and access control.

Cryptographic keys (which must be protected against unauthorized disclosure and modification).

Certificates.

Environmental credentials (e.g., credentials used to open garage doors or access computer networks via Wi-Fi).

Passwords and access codes.

<h1>II. Software and Applications</h1>
Software is increasingly the source of vehicle innovation and complexity.

Embedded Software and Code: Includes the programs running on the ECUs. A premium vehicle may contain up to several 100 megabytes of embedded code providing more than 2000 individual functions.

Firmware/Flash Memory Data: The software stored in flash memory or programs.

Software Components (SW-Cs): Such as the AUTOSAR application software components.

Reflash Routines: The procedures used to replace an ECU’s software.

Applications and Services: Includes infotainment applications, user applications, location-based services, and third-party software.

Middleware: Software layers like the AUTOSAR Run-time Environment (RTE) or ARA, which abstract applications from hardware.

<h1>III. Hardware, Physical Systems, and Processing</h1>
These are the physical components of the vehicle architecture that execute functionality or store secrets.

Electronic Control Units (ECUs): These are the "little computers inside a vehicle". Modern high-end cars can contain 80 or more processors and nearly 100 ECUs. ECUs are essential automotive embedded devices equipped with computing, communication, and control abilities.

In-Vehicle Communication Networks (IVN): The physical and logical structure connecting components, including various bus systems like CAN, LIN, FlexRay, MOST, and Automotive Ethernet.

Security Modules (Security Anchors): Dedicated cryptographic microcontrollers designed to be tamper-resistant.

External Interfaces: Connection points that permit data exchange, such as the OBD-II port, USB ports, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and cellular interfaces.

Sensors and Actuators: The components responsible for perceiving the environment (e.g., LiDAR, Radar, Camera) and executing control actions (e.g., brakes, steering). These components generate large amounts of data.

The Entire Vehicle and Components: The physical car itself and individual components that are valuable (e.g., protected against illegal exchange).

<h1>IV. Core Functions, Services, and Human Safety</h1>
These assets represent the outcomes and services delivered by the cyber-physical systems.

Safety-Critical Functions: Functions that directly impact the physical operation and safety of the vehicle and its occupants.

Primary systems such as engine control, steering, and braking.

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and electronic driving assistants.

Drive-by-wire vehicle control systems.

Secondary Functions: E.g., window control and immobilizers.

Commercial/Business Models: New IT-based business models, such as fee-based software updates and location-based services, which heavily rely on strong IT security for their viability and revenue streams.

Human Assets (Well-being): The ultimate assets being protected are the driver and passengers. The design must ensure the vehicle's functional safety (protection against technical failures) and cybersecurity (protection against malicious manipulation).
